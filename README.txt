Project: Markov model with possible extension to HMM, using indicators on the S&P 200 i want to create a transitional matrix for the probability of increasing or descreasing
depending on the current state it was in, this will be a 4 x 4 (or 200 by 200?)transitional matrix. I would like to extend the project into looking
at specific indicators within the S&P 200 that way i can create a possible HMM with the hidden states being the shift in Macro economic indicators such as; housing starts, jobless claims, retail sales
